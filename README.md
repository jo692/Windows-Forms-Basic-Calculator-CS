# Windows-Forms-Basic-Calculator-CS
A simple calculator application modelled after the old windows calculator.

Found bug 15/10/19: Pressing the * button after carrying out an addition operation seems to double the answer instantly. For example: if you input 7 + 5 then press = to get 12, following this with a * will lead to the calculation 24 * x. YET TO BE FIXED

Update 07/11/19 : Relating to the bug above, there seems to be a number of bugs associated with multiple calculations (using an answer for another calculation). The app functions fine for single calculations.
